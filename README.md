# Dwindling Galaxies

**It is a period of intergalactic war; a lone survivor must defend his home from invading alien forces; The Talz, Mondoshawans and Helghast**.

A 2D space shooter game inspired by classic arcade shooters, featuring local leaderboards, cut scenes, varying difficulty settings, and power-ups. 
This project was completed alongside three other team members using C++ and   SFML. The project included implementing local leaderboards to track 
high scores, creating engaging cut scenes for enhanced storytelling, introducing multiple difficulty levels for diverse player skill sets, and 
designing various power-ups for added excitement and strategic depth. The technical implementation utilised an object-oriented structure in C++ for  modularity and maintainability employed SFML for graphics rendering and user input handling, and incorporated collision detection and response systems 
to manage interactions between players and enemy objects, ensuring smooth gameplay.
